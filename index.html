                    I received a job offer mid-
                    course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more
                    so, in the company I joined. I
                    honestly feel I got every penny's
                    worth.

                    and have heard some people who had an
                    amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                    free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                    was the best and most grueling - time of my
                    life. Since completing the course, I've
                    successfully switched careers, working as a

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a
                    line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                    very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                    assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                    level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                    fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
